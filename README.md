![App Logo](app_logo.png)

This repository serves as a demonstration of setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for a Flutter app called "flutter_app_testflight_cicd" to deploy it to TestFlight. With this CI/CD setup, your Flutter app can be automatically deployed to TestFlight for beta testing.

## Overview

In this repository, we showcase how to automate the deployment process of a Flutter app to TestFlight using Fastlane and a CI/CD service. The setup includes:

- Configuring Fastlane for iOS app deployment.
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to trigger deployments on code changes.
- Automating the upload of your "flutter_app_testflight_cicd" app to TestFlight.

Follow the steps below to get started with the CI/CD setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Flutter app named "flutter_app_testflight_cicd" that you want to deploy.
- An active Apple Developer account.
- Fastlane installed on your local development machine.
- A CI/CD service (e.g., GitHub Actions, Bitrise, CircleCI) integrated with your GitHub repository.
